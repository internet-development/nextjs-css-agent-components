            A conventional documentation page implementation, designed in the familiar form of a commit message but serves the same function as a blog post, or a pamphlet. It
            stands as an inquiry into the liminal relationship between the blog post and the commit message. Blog posts and commit messages are often decoupled forms of expression,
            yet the structural similarities are so simple. This document asks not only what distinguishes them, but why such distinctions persist. Does there need to be a
            distinction? And why do these forms resist reconciliation. Is there even a resistance or are we just use to it all?

              Welcome to the Internet Development Studio Company. Each person here is given one roll of two twenty-sided dice each day. What you roll becomes your directive for the
              day. Following it keeps you in good standing with the janitors. But don’t worry,they are not ones to hold grudges. They forget quickly, as if they understand that we
              are all just doing our best to follow whatever the world throws at us.
